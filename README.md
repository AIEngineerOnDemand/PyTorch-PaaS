# PyTorch Use Cases

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the main use cases of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library. PyTorch is widely used in the tech industry for a variety of tasks, including:

## Computer Vision

PyTorch's flexibility and efficient tensor computations make it suitable for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Companies use PyTorch for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

## Reinforcement Learning

PyTorch is used to develop models that can learn to make decisions from their experiences.

## Generative Models

PyTorch is used in creating generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) which can generate new content.

## Research

Due to its dynamic computation graph and efficient memory usage, PyTorch is also a popular choice in the research community.

Stay tuned for more updates and examples of PyTorch use cases.

## Development Approach

In our project, we prioritize efficient development practices to ensure rapid iteration and robust code quality, even on machines with limited resources. Here's how we achieve this:

### Fast Iterations and Local Testing

We understand the importance of being able to quickly test changes without the need for extensive setup or reliance on high-resource environments. To support this, we've implemented functionality that allows for the simulation or mocking of complex operations. This enables developers to run tests locally, ensuring that the code behaves as expected before moving to more resource-intensive testing environments. This approach significantly reduces the development cycle time and improves productivity.

### Separation of Concerns

Our codebase is structured around the principle of separation of concerns, ensuring that different parts of the application are modular and independent. This design philosophy allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability. By separating the application into distinct sections based on functionality, developers can work on individual components without the risk of causing unintended side effects in unrelated parts of the application.

This modular approach also facilitates the implementation of mock models and data for local testing, as developers can easily swap out or modify components without affecting the core functionality of the application.

### Why This Matters

By incorporating these practices into our development process, we aim to create a more efficient and error-resistant workflow. This allows our team to focus on innovation and the development of high-quality features, even when working on devices with limited computational power. It's a testament to our commitment to not only achieving our project goals but also to adhering to best practices in software development.

## Running the Code on Google Colab

Follow these steps to run the `main.py` script on Google Colab:

1. Open a new Google Colab notebook.

2. Clone the repository into the current directory in your Google Colab environment by running the following command in a new cell:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/AIEngineerOnDemand/PyTorch-Use-Cases.git
```

Running the Code on a GPU
To run your Google Colab notebook on a GPU, you can follow these steps:

Click on the 'Runtime' menu in the top toolbar.
Select 'Change runtime type' from the dropdown menu.
In the pop-up window, under 'Hardware accelerator', select 'GPU' from the dropdown menu.
Click 'Save'.
After doing this, your notebook will have access to a GPU, and any TensorFlow or PyTorch code you run will automatically use the GPU.

You can verify that your notebook is using a GPU by running the following code:

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```
This will print True if a GPU is available and False otherwise.
