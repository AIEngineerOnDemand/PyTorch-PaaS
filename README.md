# PyTorch Use Cases

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the main use cases of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library. PyTorch is widely used in the tech industry for a variety of tasks, including:

## Computer Vision

PyTorch's flexibility and efficient tensor computations make it suitable for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Companies use PyTorch for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

## Reinforcement Learning

PyTorch is used to develop models that can learn to make decisions from their experiences.

## Generative Models

PyTorch is used in creating generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) which can generate new content.

## Research

Due to its dynamic computation graph and efficient memory usage, PyTorch is also a popular choice in the research community.

Stay tuned for more updates and examples of PyTorch use cases.

## Running the Code on Google Colab

To run the code on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/.
2. Click on the `File` menu and select `Open notebook`.
3. In the dialog that opens, select the `GitHub` tab.
4. Enter the URL of this GitHub repository and press Enter.
5. A list of notebooks in the repository will appear. Click on the one you want to open.

If your code is not in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file), you will need to create a new notebook and copy your code into it. Here's how:

1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2. In the first cell of the notebook, clone this GitHub repository by running the following command (replace `your-repo-url` with the URL of your repository):

```python
!git clone git@github.com:AIEngineerOnDemand/PyTorch-Use-Cases.git
```

3. You can then navigate to the cloned repository and run your Python files using the !python command. For example, if your file is named base_model.py, you can run it like this:
```bash
!python main.py
```
Remember to install any necessary libraries using !pip install before running your code. For example:

Also, if your code requires a GPU, make sure to change the runtime type to GPU. You can do this by clicking on the Runtime menu, selecting Change runtime type, and choosing GPU under Hardware accelerator.
