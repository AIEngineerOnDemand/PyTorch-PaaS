# PyTorch Image Classification Models

In this project, we explore several popular deep learning models used for image classification tasks with PyTorch. Here are the models we will be experimenting with:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: These are the most commonly used models for image classification tasks. They consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. LeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet are examples of CNNs.

- **ResNet (Residual Network)**: This is a type of CNN that introduces "skip connections" or "shortcuts" to allow the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers. It's known for its ability to train very deep networks.

- **Inception (GoogLeNet)**: This model introduces a new module called the "Inception module" that allows for more efficient computation and deeper networks.

- **DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks)**: In this model, each layer is connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, which can lead to lower complexity models.

- **EfficientNet**: This is a newer model that scales the width, depth, and resolution of the network for better performance.

- **MobileNet**: This model is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the model size and complexity, making it suitable for mobile applications.

- **Transformer Models (like Vision Transformer - ViT)**: While originally designed for NLP tasks, Transformer models have recently been adapted for image classification tasks and have shown competitive results.

We will be training and evaluating all these models on our dataset and comparing their performance. The choice of model depends on the specific task, the size and nature of our dataset, computational resources, and the trade-off between speed and accuracy that we're willing to make.
